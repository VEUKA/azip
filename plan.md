# CLI Download Tool Plan

- [x] Clarify CLI behavior and options.
- [x] Update project dependencies and tooling for Playwright and Typer usage under `uv`.
- [x] Design Python package structure for CLI and downloader modules.
- [x] Implement download workflow with Playwright to capture the JSON file.
- [x] Wire the Typer-based CLI command that invokes the downloader.
- [x] Add tests to cover default filename and `--filename` override flows.
- [x] Document setup, usage, and testing steps, including required Playwright browser install.
- [x] Validate everything with `uv` commands (formatting if available, tests, and manual CLI run).
